# About me
Random stuff about me I guess

-I'm MapleSpace

-My favorite aircraft is the Boeing 777-9X (although it'd be tied with the Lockheed Martin QSTA)

-I wish that the Lockheed Martin L1011 Tristar wasn't a failure; that the Boeing 2707 SST would have actually been made, and that the Avro Arrow was actually made

-Opportunity is my favorite rover and it will always be remembered by me; Perseverance might be better though we'll have to see
